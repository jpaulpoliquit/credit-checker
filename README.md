# Cursor Referral Validator

A toolkit for validating Cursor referral codes to check which codes are still valid and unclaimed.

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

**Using uv (Recommended)** - Fast, modern Python package manager:

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install all dependencies (creates .venv automatically)
uv sync
```

That's it! `uv` will automatically create a virtual environment and install all dependencies.

**Using pip (Alternative)**:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

### Basic Workflow

1. **Add your referral links** to `data/links.csv`
2. **Validate codes** using the referral checker
3. **Review results** in `data/referral_check_results.txt`

## 📝 Usage

### Validate Referral Codes

**Default (Headless Browser)**:
```bash
uv run python3 check_referrals.py
```

**Using Your Existing Chrome Profile** (with cookies, login state, etc.):
```bash
export CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome"
uv run python3 check_referrals.py
```

**Connecting to Existing Chrome Instance**:
1. First, start Chrome with remote debugging enabled:
   ```bash
   /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
   ```
2. Then run the script:
   ```bash
   export USE_EXISTING_BROWSER=True
   uv run python3 check_referrals.py
   ```

The script automatically validates all referral codes:
- Reads from `data/links.csv`
- Checks each code's validity via cursor.com using Chrome
- Identifies valid (unclaimed) vs invalid (claimed) codes
- Displays progress and results in the console
- Saves valid codes to `data/referral_check_results.txt`

**Requirements**: Chrome browser and ChromeDriver
```bash
brew install chromedriver
```

## 📋 Input Format

Your `data/links.csv` should have the following format:

```csv
link,name
https://cursor.com/referral?code=XX8CYFK0A0P,User1
https://cursor.com/referral?code=RN4TZ8KQV06Q,User2
https://cursor.com/referral?code=VXF6B8MKDTRY,User3
```

## 📂 Output Files

Results are saved to `data/`:
- `referral_check_results.txt` - Validation results showing which codes are valid/unclaimed

## 🎨 Branding Assets

Official Cursor branding assets are located in `assets/cursor_branding/`:
- App Icons (2D, 2.5D, 3D variants)
- Avatars (Circle & Square)
- General Logos (Cube, Lockups, Wordmarks)
- Available in PNG, SVG, and PSD formats

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Dependencies**: All managed through `pyproject.toml`
- **Locked versions**: `uv.lock` (auto-generated by uv)
- **Virtual environment**: `.venv/` (auto-created by uv sync)

### Managing Dependencies

```bash
# Add a new dependency
uv add package-name

# Update all dependencies
uv sync --upgrade

# Remove a dependency
uv remove package-name
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Vercel Security Checkpoint**: Sometimes Cursor.com may present a Vercel security checkpoint that the script is unable to bypass automatically. In these cases, the script may fail to validate codes properly. This is a known limitation that needs to be addressed.

## 💡 Tips

1. **Before using codes**: Run the validator to ensure codes are still valid
2. **Rate limiting**: The script includes a 1-second delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the server
3. **Interrupt safely**: Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the script at any time - it will clean up the browser instance
4. **Vercel checkpoint**: If you encounter Vercel security checkpoints, you may need to manually handle them or use an existing Chrome profile with cookies
